## Overview of the analysis:
For this analysis we worked with Dana, a data journalist who has the opportuity to write about her hometown McMinnville, Oregon. 
She wants to get a webpage where she wanted to provided UFO sighting information. 

Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.


## Results:

- Finale filters: date, city, state, country and shape
- List that creates button is removed 
- Both updatedFilters () and filterTable () functions where added  

## Summary:
There are a lot more ways to find information of sightings with the filters added and this way you can be more specific on what criteria you are wanting to reviews. However, some recommendations would be to possibly update the info since it is dated only for 2010 and also the change the data to look more presentable in the webpage (e.g. capitalizing city name, state and country abbreviation).

One drawback for the webpage is also no images to view the sightings, it would be more captivating if you could provide a visual to the sightings.
